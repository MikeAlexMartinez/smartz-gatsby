        I am a Xero certified bookkeeper who started ‘Smartz Bookkeeping &
        Accounts’ here in Bicester a number of years ago and I am positive
        that I can add value to your business to support you in achieving
        your company goals. With 30 years’ experience in bookkeeping and
        accounts I am looking to offer my services to local businesses who
        need help with their bookkeeping and accounts.

        I have many years’ of experience using various accounting products
        including Sage, Sage business cloud and Xero software. I can also
        make use of Dext software that speeds up data entry and attaches
        images of documents to the transactions in your accounting package,
        making data entry more efficient and cost effective. I am also
        experienced in transferring my clients from old outdated accounting
        software solutions and processes onto modern, time efficient
        software that can help move your business forward.

        Good bookkeeping can help you keep track of what is happening in
        your business and enable smooth running of your accounts. It also
        helps with planning for a successful future with accurate facts
        and figures at your fingertips. Small business owners often try
        to do their books themselves, this takes away time from what
        matters most - servicing your own clients. Have you ever run out
        of time getting your accounts in order to sort your VAT return
        and/or end of year accounts? I would like to avoid this
        unnecessary stress by working with you to keep everything in
        order in a timely fashion.

        It may be that you need some temporary help, or a regular amount

        reasonable rates.
