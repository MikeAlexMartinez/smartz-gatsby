  - I have recently started ‘Smartz Bookkeeping & Accounts’ here in 
    Bicester and I am positive that I can add value to your business to
    support you in achieving your company goals.
  - With 27 years’ experience in bookkeeping and accounts I am looking
    to offer my services to local businesses who need help with their
    bookkeeping and accounts.
  - Good bookkeeping can help you keep track of what is happening in
    your business and enable smooth running of your accounts. It also
    helps with planning for a successful future with accurate facts and
    figures at your fingertips.
  - Small business owners often try to do their books themselves, this
    takes away time from what matters most - servicing your own clients.
    Have you ever run out of time getting your accounts in order to sort
    your VAT return and/or end of year accounts? I would like to avoid
    this unnecessary stress by working with you to keep everything in
    order in a timely fashion.
  - The bookkeeping services I am offering includes, payroll and RTI,
    bank reconciliations, CIS returns, VAT returns, credit control/debt
    chasing, processing sales and purchase invoices, cash flow reporting
    and ad hoc reporting as needed.
  - It may be that you need some temporary help, or a regular amount of
    work done each week/month. My services are offered at very reasonable
    rates.
