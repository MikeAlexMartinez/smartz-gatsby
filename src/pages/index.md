        I have recently started ‘Smartz Bookkeeping & Accounts’ here in 
        Bicester and I am positive that I can add value to your business 
        tosupport you in achieving your company goals. With 27 years’ 
        experience in bookkeeping and accounts I am looking
        to offer my services to local businesses who need help with their
        bookkeeping and accounts.

        Good bookkeeping can help you keep track of what is happening in
        your business and enable smooth running of your accounts. It also
        helps with planning for a successful future with accurate facts 
        and figures at your fingertips. Small business owners often try 
        to do their books themselves, this takes away time from what 
        matters most - servicing your own clients. Have you ever run out 
        of time getting your accounts in order to sort your VAT return 
        and/or end of year accounts? I would like to avoid this 
        unnecessary stress by working with you to keep everything in 
        order in a timely fashion.

        It may be that you need some temporary help, or a regular amount 
        of work done each week/month. My services are offered at very 
        reasonable rates.
