    title: Bank Reconciliations
    textItems:
      - Keeping up to date with Bank reconciliations is very important
        so you can be confident that the information you are looking at on
        your accounts ledgers is correct.
      - You want to be sure that you know payments you have had in from customers
        have been allocated and that any payments that have gone out of your
        bank account are what you expected them to be.

    title: Processing Sales and Purchase Invoices
    textItems:
      - It is important that sales invoices are produced quickly and with enough
        detail to bring in money to your business. The longer it takes to bill
        your customers the longer it will take to get paid.
      - Purchase invoices from your suppliers also need to be put onto your
        accounting system accurately and can be allocated to individual projects
        to keep track of costs and make sure each project is on track with your
        budget and costs can be monitored.

        to forecast the cash flowing through the business.
